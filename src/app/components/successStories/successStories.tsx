      "I joined Metana back in February 2023 to level up my Blockchain skills, I had some basic knowledge of Solidity + proficient in Javascript, but after putting in around 20 hours a week for 3-4 months(you may require discipline), I've gained a ton of skills. Plus, I've had the chance to meet some amazing people, like the Metana team and the other students. In fact, I'm even working on projects with one of the Metana students right now.",

      "I'm currently enrolled in the Metana bootcamp. So far, it's been a very pleasurable experience. I would definitely recommend this course for people who might have some basic knowledge of Solidity or programming in general since the learning curve is quite steep and there's a lot of information packed into the different modules.",
      "The mentors are very knowledgeable about their subjects and can give you in-depth guidance about specific questions you have. These are the kinds of things I've experienced, so I would definitely join up if you want to become a Solidity expert and learn everything from security to the implementation of smart contracts.",
